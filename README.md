    <u><h2 align="center">Installations</h2></u>
</p>

- First create a Firebase Project
- Go to your Firebase project Dashboard and click on storage in the build tab. Once you have initialized your firebase storage, inside the storage menu there will be a tab called **Rules**, where you would have to change the following line:
```
 allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
```
to 
```
 allow read, write: if request.auth == null;
```

-  Generate an serviceAccountkey for your firebase project. Go to your ```Firebase project -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts``` and download the firebase SDK by clicking ```Generate New Private Key``` button
- Rename the file to ``` serviceAccountKey.json ``` and put it in the root folder. The file will look like this
```
 {
  "type": ,
  "project_id": ,
  "private_key_id": ,
  "private_key": ,
  "client_email": ,
  "client_id": ,
  "auth_uri": ,
  "token_uri": ,
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": ,
  "client_x509_cert_url": 
}
```

- Create a ```.env``` file and enter your create a variable called BUCKET_URL and store your firebase bucket url

```
  BUCKET_URL=YOUR_BUCKET_URL
```

- To install all the dependencies run 
```bash
npm i
```
- Please also run this command
```bash
brew install GraphicsMagick
```

  - The file's download url is generated using firebase

<p align="center">
    <u><h2 align="center">Future Features</h2></u>
</p>
- Make the UI interface for the app
- Update the create inventory request so that it accepts images as well.


<p align="center">
    <u><h2 align="center">Note for Shopify Developers</h2></u>
</p>
- If required I will migrate to aws or gcp in the future releases.
- Currently the create inventory request only accepts two body parameters which are `item name` and `quantity`, if required i can update it and store more metadata such as expirty date, product_condition,shipment date,etc
